                    <h2>About me:</h2>
                    <p class="lead text-justify">I am married, I have a beautiful wife Kate who is a teacher at Primary School in Warsaw. We like traveling and visiting foreign countries and cities. Full year we are walking and during the winter season we are ice skating. We are spending our leisure time playing the board games, reading interesting books or watching good movies.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-justify">At work I believe I am hard-working, and never give up when the first obstacles occur. I think I am well organized, I am able to organize and plan the work (for me and the others as well). I am not a conflict person, I am able to communicate with other members of the team - even when I am boiling because somebody is playing on my nerves I never show it up. All my life I try to be flexible, I am able to adapt to new conditions and new environment. I am always happy to learn new technologies, and all the time I try to keep an optimistic approach. I don't regret the failures but only missed chances.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-justify">I am software developer who is trying to spend free time in an active way. I'm keen on running and riding bicycle as well as trekking - I love mountains. Sport helps me a lot in my profession, after the  activity I feel like new born, my productivity at work increases and I am able to look from the different perspective at the problems I was facing.I live close to the Kabaty forest which helps me a lot in jogging regularly. Gassy – the real mecca for the cyclists is almost in my neighborhood and during the season I am very often a guest at that place. You can check my progress at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/12081531">Strava</a>. From time to time I participate at running events in Warsaw - mainly 10km or half-marathons.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-justify">I am also fascinated by Spanish language and culture. I speak Spanish and all the time I try to improve my language skills. I am great fan of Carlos Ruiz Zafón and I am keen on reading his books in Spanish. I speak also a little German.
